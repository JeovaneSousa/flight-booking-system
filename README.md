# flight-booking-system
This was the final project of my second Five Academy's Java backend Study pathway. It is an abstraction of a flight booking system. I tried to use as much Java resources as i could to showcase what i learned durin this period.

##The following topics were approached during development:
- Java Collections.
- Java Io.
- Data Structures.
- Object Oriented Programing.
- Clean code and design.
- Git flow.

##The following tools were used during the project development:
- Java 17 or later versions.
- Git for product version control.
- GitHub as a web repository.
- Intellj IDEA Community Edition as an IDE.
